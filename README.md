# Project Overview
Hey, we are BioMatrix, a matrix that strives to solve all environment related problems around the globe, as our time was limited we are solving problems of excessive carbon footprint, poor waste classification and tweaking around the same.

# Problem Statement
Modern cities face a stacked sustainability crisis: waste is mismanaged because people don’t know how to sort it, buildings are built with zero focus on sustainability or heat efficiency, and households keep emitting carbon without any real tracking or awareness. This combo fuels climate change, overheats urban spaces, and increases pollution, all because everyday users lack simple, accessible tools to guide better choices.
